# Setup
Device: M2 upper limb rehabilitation robot.
Software: Unity 3D 2018.x

# Experiment
1. Customized preset initial and ending points for each subject
2. Subjects actively move to ending points by themself and passively move back to initial points by M2.
3. Kinematics by M2 and sEMG by Delsys would be saved to .csv file.

# Files keep
1. Task information would be recorded to .YAML file.
2. Each task, including several trials, is one block. States mashine of motion are in kinematics.csv.
3. Use kinematics data to reassign sEMG.
